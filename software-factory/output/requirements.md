# Requirements Specification

## Original Idea

Build a simple CLI calculator

## Final Requirements
### Functional
- The calculator must accept two numbers as input from the user.
- The calculator must perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the input numbers.
- The calculator must display the result of the operation to the user.

### Non-Functional
- The calculator should be able to handle invalid inputs (e.g. non-numeric characters).
- The calculator should be able to handle overflow or underflow errors.

### Assumptions
- The user will enter two numbers and a valid arithmetic operator.
- The calculator will not need to perform any advanced calculations like polynomial equations or matrices.

### Constraints
- The calculator must run on a standard Linux/Unix environment.
- The calculator should use the minimum number of external libraries possible.
